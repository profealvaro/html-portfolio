<h1>The Best Movies According to Alvaro</h1>

<h2>My top three movies of all-time</h2>

<h3>Patch Adams</h3>
<p>
  This is my favorite movie of all-time because; I love people. I am nobody
  without people. I enjoy working with people.
</p>
<h3>Scent of a Woman</h3>
<p>
  This movie has got it all. Laughter, tears, and conflicting emotional
  thoughts. Scent of a Woman is a 1992 American drama film produced and directed
  by Martin Brest.
